would provide several prompts for certain user-input criteria.  

### Required criteria for user to input

1. user input of password length between 8 - 128 characters
2. user input of 4 different character-types
    * special characters: [ASCII characters](https://theasciicode.com.ar/)
    * numbers: 0-9
    * lower case characters: a-z
    * upper case characters: A-Z
3. validation of each criteria
    * length must be within parameters and must be TRUE
    * at least one character-type must be TRUE
4. new password to be returned to textarea of html element
